## Vision

The **Token Airdrop** smart contract provides a decentralized and efficient method for distributing tokens to multiple recipients. This contract is designed to simplify token distribution, allowing projects to reward or engage with their communities through airdrops, ensuring transparency and ease of use.

## Features

- **Airdrop Tokens**:
  - The contract allows the owner to distribute tokens to a list of recipients, automating the process for efficient mass token distribution.
- **Balance Checking**:
  - Recipients or other users can check the token balance of any account.

## Future Scope

1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Optimize the airdrop function for batch processing, supporting larger recipient lists and token amounts.
2. **Airdrop Scheduling**:

   - Introduce functionality to schedule airdrops for future dates, enabling time-based token distribution.

3. **Multi-Token Airdrops**:
   - Expand the contract to support airdrops in multiple token types, offering flexibility for projects with diverse token offerings.

The **Token Airdrop** smart contract simplifies the process of token distribution, providing a transparent and secure mechanism to reward users or distribute tokens across a wide audience.
